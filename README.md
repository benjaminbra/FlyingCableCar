# Arduino Based RF controlled car

This project aim at creating a vehicule we can control using a RF controller. This was our end project for the IOT lessons we got at Ynov Campus.

This vehicule is composed of a lot of parts we listed in this document //TODO insert file link

You can find the code for the fully handcontrolled prototype we made.

It was a lot of fun doing this, so we hope you'll enjoy it :D
